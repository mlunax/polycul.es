Graphing polyamorous relationships with force directed layouts.

## Development

You will need to install Python, virtualenv, and GraphViz using whatever package manager your operating system uses.  Then you can setup, run and test the application as follows:

1. Create a new virtualenv environment by running `make`
2. Install dependencies by running `make deps`
3. Run the application by running `make run` and opening http://localhost:5000/ in a browser
4. Run the tests by running `make test`
